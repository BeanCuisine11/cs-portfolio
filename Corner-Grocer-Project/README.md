# Corner Grocer Project (CS210)

## Project Summary
The Corner Grocer project was designed to help a grocery manager track how often specific items appear on a given list. The program reads items from an input text file, counts how many times each item appears, and displays the results in both text form and as a histogram. This solves the problem of manually tracking inventory frequency and makes it easier to identify popular products.

## What I Did Well
I believe I did particularly well in organizing the logic for reading the input file and storing item frequencies. I structured my code clearly and made sure the output was easy to understand. The histogram display turned out clean and user-friendly.

## Areas for Improvement
One area I could enhance is optimizing the code for scalability and handling invalid input more securely. I could add better error checking if the file is missing or if there are unexpected characters in the file. Improving efficiency would help the program run faster with larger datasets.

## Challenges and How I Overcame Them
One of the most challenging parts was using data structures to count item frequencies correctly. I overcame this by researching how to use loops and possibly maps (if you used `map<string, int>`) to store key/value pairs. I also used online documentation and class materials to understand file handling in C++ more clearly.

## Skills Gained and Transferable Knowledge
From this project, I gained experience in file I/O, loops, data structures (like maps or vectors), and string processing. These skills are transferable to future programming work, especially in projects that involve data processing or user input.

## Code Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I made the program maintainable by using clear variable names, adding comments to explain functions, and writing my code in a logical structure. This makes it easier for others (or myself in the future) to understand and modify the program if needed.
